/-- Define a sequence by $a_1=1$ and $$a_{n+1}=\lfloor\sqrt{2}(a_n+1/2)\rfloor$$ for $n\geq 1$.
The difference $a_{2n+1}-2a_{2n-1}$ is the $n$th digit in the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$.

Find similar results for $\theta=\sqrt{m}$, and other algebraic numbers.

The result for $\sqrt{2}$ was obtained by Graham and Pollak [GrPo70]. The problem statement is
open-ended, but presumably Erdős and Graham would have been satisfied with the wide-ranging
generalisations of Stoll ([St05] and [St06]).

The binary expansion is $\sqrt{2} = 1.0110101\ldots$, and the $n$th digit counts the leading $1$ as
digit $1$. That digit is $\lfloor \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{n-1} \rfloor \bmod 2$. -/

/-- Stoll's general answer to the open-ended part [St05]: for every real $w > 0$ and every base
$g \ge 2$, there are parameters $a$, $b$, and $\varepsilon$, with $ab = g$, such that the
corresponding Graham–Pollak-type recurrence reads the base-$g$ digits of $w$.

The mantissa normalization is $w / g^{\lfloor \log_g w \rfloor}$, so the right-hand side is the
standard Mathlib base-$g$ digit of the normalized expansion. -/
