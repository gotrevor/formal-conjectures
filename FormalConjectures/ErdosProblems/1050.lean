# Erdős Problem 1050

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1050](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1050)

Is $\sum_{n} \frac{1}{2^n - 3}$ irrational?

The answer is **yes**, proved by P. B. Borwein, *On the irrationality of $\sum 1/(q^n + r)$*,
J. Number Theory **37** (1991) 253-259 (cleaner self-contained proof in *On the irrationality of
certain series*, Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. **112** (1992) 141-146), specialized to $q = 2$,
$r = -3$.

A formal Lean proof is given in an external repository,
[`gotrevor/lean-gallery`](https://github.com/gotrevor/lean-gallery), formalized by Trevor Morris with
Claude Code and Harmonic's Aristotle.
